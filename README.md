## General info
This project is a challenge to use Matplotlib to analyze and visualize pharmaceutical data.

##Observations
- Sex of mouse does not affect treatment.  The treatments have been distributed evenly between male and female mice.
- Weight is a factor in tumor volume and treatment time.  The larger the mouse, the larger the tumor is and the longer it takes for the tumor to reduce in size.
- Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective treatments reducing tumor size at a faster rate.
